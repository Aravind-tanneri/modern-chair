## ✨ Key Features

* **Zero JavaScript Logic:** State management handles purely via the "Radio Button Hack" and CSS peers.
* **Tailwind v4 Configuration:** Uses the new `@theme` block for custom animations and color variables.
* **Advanced Selectors:** utilizes `body:has()` to control global background gradients from a local component.
* **Custom Animations:** Features a custom "Shake" effect on selection and "Fade Up" entry animations.
* **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layout that transforms into an overlapping grid on desktop.
* **Dynamic Theming:** "Add to Cart" button automatically adapts its color to match the selected chair.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
